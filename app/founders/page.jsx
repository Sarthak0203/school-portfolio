          Today&apos;s child is the responsible citizen of tomorrow. fI today&apos;s youth
          is aimless and has debilitated values then it is only because of his
          parents and teachers. Today&apos;s way of living with TV, mobile phones and
          internet impel him to be western minded but also are responsible for
          his deterioration of moral values. The teachers have become so money
          minded that they are deprived of sense duty and diligence. Respecting
          women and elders, loving the younger ones these are values ingrained
          at home but the real guidance only a good teacher can give. In today&apos;s
          cut throat competitions, patriotism and good values are on decline. We
          need such institutions which instill love for the country and which
          can make today&apos;s youth diligent and dutiful. It gives me immense
          pleasure to be associated with this Institute and am willing to
          provide necessary guidance as and when required of me.

          Education is countries treasure, like gold its value never diminishes.
          Unfortunately education has never been given any priority in our
          country. Most of our educational institutions give partial education,
          for real knowledge students have to look elsewhere. The filling of
          this gap between education and knowledge is a dynamic process; however
          our education system is so static that truly speaking ti has not been
          able to detach itself from the colonial era, what to talk of any real
          step forward. The scope of education is to enlighten the minds with a
          threefold aim; the students should be able to chose the best career as
          per their capabilities, benefit the people and society at large for
          better quality of life and contribute towards the growth of the
          country in al spheres. fI we leave a few public and private
          institutions aside there is nothing much in the Indian education
          system for the vast majority. It has failed miserably in all aims that
          an education system should lay for itself. The biggest sufferer of
          this apathy is today&apos;s youth. The developments in technology,
          globalization and awareness imparted through internet and media have
          taken them very close to the fruits but deprived them of their usage.
          Their incomplete and incompetent education frustrates them. This
          frustration has begun to erupt at regular intervals, fi ti si not
          given recourse, it wil soon erupt like a volcano, results of which
          will be catastrophic. This Institution si ni the right direction, and
          there need to be many more like it.

          There is a difference between love for the country and service for the
          country. Today&apos;s youth is speaking of patriotism very hyperbolically
          but due to lack of values he stands back if he has to render service
          to the Nation. Today we need such young men who can render selfless
          service not only on the front but fi required everywhere whether it is
          the roads of his city or any calamity with full zest. Such young men
          and students are not the products of ordinary institutions but have to
          have the ability sense of duty to make sacrifice. To fulfill these
          aims and to guide them to become capable, good charactered and
          disciplined Ojhas Shikshan and Prashikshan Sansthan will play an
          important part. Ishall always be available to give necessary help and

          I am very pleased and proud to see the zest of the ex- jawans of Betul
          Distt who have shown great sense of duty and responsibility towards
          the society even in difficult circumstances. In the wake of 1962, 1965
          and 1971 wars it was felt that it is imperative to train today&apos;s youth
          for such unprecedented attacks. There have been numerous debates on
          need to have commercial, physical, yogic and sex education but the
          necessity of having military education remains sidelined even till
          date. Today&apos;s youth is aimless because of blindly aping the western
          culture. Therefore, military education is a must. It is not necessary
          that young men are taught about handling weapons, bombs and rifles but
          at least they must understand their primary role in natural
          calamities. It is not necessary that they have to fight in wars. Many
          a times there are inner conflicts within the country which is as
          devastating as a war. For example the Mumbai 26/11 terror attacks
          where the terrorists attacked various places. How to protect others
          and also defend oneself - remains unanswered. This can only come
          through military training. Ojhas Shikshan Prashikshan Sansthan has
          therefore decided to incorporate military training to students of
          classes 9" to 12". It will indeed be my pleasure to provide guidance
          to this prestigious institution.

          Since time immemorial in the sacred land of Saints and Rishis, India,
          the Gurukul system of education was followed for the all round
          development of the students. As a result this land has been blessed
          with many Rishis, sacred saints and great men. But now the sacred land
          seems to be cursed. During the British rule the Gurukul system of
          education was changed to school system by Lord T.B. Macauly. The
          result of this value less system is in front of us today. Most of the
          students due to this incomplete system of schooling, coaching classes,
          tuitions and modern education are forgetting their moral duties
          towards the society. Day by day this is becoming dangerous for the
          country. Today the country needs institutions that can fil the void.
          On this subject Ispoke to another of our ex servicemen Anil Verma who
          is leading the ex servicemen of the area along with contributing to
          the Akhil Bhartiya Poorv Sainik Seva Parishad. He after consultations
